# SolidityBinding

⚠️ Experimental

CLI tool to generate bindings for this [swift Web3 library](https://github.com/Boilertalk/Web3.swift) by Boilertalk. Executable is not provided because compiling swift package to a single executable is difficult. The typed branch implements static return type but it requires extra code which can be found [here](https://github.com/stevealexrs/Web3.swift/blob/master/Sources/Web3ContractABI/ContractABI/Contract/SolidityTypedInvocation.swift).

## Usage

```
swift run SwiftSolidityBinding [file or folder path]
```
Provide a file or folder path for the json generated by solidity compiler. 

### Command Line Options
Argument:
- File or folder path of json file

Flags:
- --classname: Add the word "Contract" to the end of classname and filename.

Optional Arguments:
- --import: Override "import Web3" with your own import. Only required if you change module name.
